This is my attempt at re-creating a simple calculator. In order to aid me better at learning React, I also try to manage all the logics of calculations manually and only resort to Math library when necessary. There is nothing 
fancy about this, but it has helped me learn React a lot deeper.
To run this, please download the whole Calculator file, open the terminal, and hit "npm run dev"
